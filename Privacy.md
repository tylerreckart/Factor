#  Privacy Policy

## Overview

This Privacy Policy decribes how your personal information is handled in Ansel.

## We Collect No Personal Information

We do not collect, use, save, or have access to any of your personal data stored in Ansel.

Individual settings and any data generated by Ansel are not personal and are stored only on your device. You may be asked to provide access to your photo library, but this is only so that you may open your photos in Ansel and save them in your stored notes. We do not process that information at all and have no access to it.

In addition, if you take a photo using Ansel, location data is saved in the image, but we have no access to that data and it is not shared with anyone unless you yourself choose to share the image.
