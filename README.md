#  Aspen

Aspen was built with the goal of being the analog photographer's perfect field companion. It allows the user to take notes, adjust exposure values due to reciprocity, bellows extension, and filter factors.

_Aspen is not available on the iOS app store. It is still in the early phases of development, but this repo can be cloned and built locally to run on device._

### Roadmap
- [ ] Spot meter
- [ ] Including meter data in notes
- [x] Including compensation data in notes
- [x] UI customizations (dark/light modes)
